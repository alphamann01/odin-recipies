    <h2 class="h2">Why i love cheeseburgers</h2>
    <p>Ever since i was young, I have loved cheeseburgers. Depebding on which one you get, yours could could be compact enough to fill you up for the rest of the day. Also cheeseburgers are extremely customizable.</p>
    <p>Cheeseburgers taste good because they are full of complex flavors and textures which stimulate the mind as well as the palate. They are also very rich and satiating. Few people feel hungry after gobbling one down.</p>
    <p>Burgers, like most fast food, are made with so much chemicals and so much preservatives and so much sugar that it becomes like a drug to us, making us want to eat more and more. Sugar is an addictive “drug” not only because it tastes good but because it seemingly wakes you up (A good thing if you ask me).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li class="li">Bun</li>
        <li class="li">Cheese</li>
        <li class="li">Onion</li>
        <li class="li">Ground Beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol id="ordered-list" class="ordered-list">
        <li id="ordered-li" class="ordered-li">In a pan on medium-high heat, drizzle the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to the beef patties. Cook the parries for 3-4 minutes on both sides. Flip the burger and add the cheese on the cooked side to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li id="ordered-li" class="ordered-li">In another pan on medium-high heat, toast the buns face down. Remove, then spread the ketchup and mustard. Start assembling the burger by adding the lettuce, tomato slice, and patty on top of the other half of the bun. Top with the condiment bun.</li>
    </ol>
